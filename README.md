<h1><p align=center>wojchan</p></h1>
<p align=center><img src="icon.png"></img></p>
<p align=center>a very small project and its just a pet that follows your mouse</p>

## how to I add it to my site?
You can copy the code of the minified JavaScript file into `<script>` tags into your site and a small wojchan should appear.
**This dosen't work when you import the file from this project**

## can I change the sprite?
Yes! just replace the image URL which uses the image from this project, with your own image, and it should change.
the spritesheet looks like this:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| walk cycle 1 (flipped) | idle/walk cycle 2 (flipped) | walk cycle 3 (flipped) |
|       walk cycle 1     |      idle/walk cycle 2      |      walk cycle 3      |
|         shadow         |            sweat            |     sweat (flipped)    |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
You can even add more if you want to! (30x30 for one tile is used here)
